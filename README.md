# CardGames

This was the first major project in my C# programming 2 class. The assignment was to build a card game framework that could apply to multiple different card games.
This helped learn about OOP concepts. 

The program has 3 games you can play in it. Apples or Oranges, Higher or Lower, and Highest Match. The first two are simple games where you guess what the next card drawn will be.
Highest Match is the best game of the bunch. It's about building the highest value hand of the same suit, and you compete against an AI dealer who is trying to do the same.
It is actually really fun and worth playing some. I had a good time writing the Dealer AI.
